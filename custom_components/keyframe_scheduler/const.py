# min_interval:   minimum time between two commands to the same light (seconds)
#                 — protects slow buses (DALI, Bluetooth mesh) from flooding.
# Every light is driven at its own pace: it follows the curve in pieces of at
# most max_transition, each command fading to the curve's value at the end of
# the piece (light_logic.plan_step).
# The max_transition values are the hardware limits the integration has always
# used; the min_interval values are conservative defaults — adjust them per
# instance (options) to what your installation handles.
