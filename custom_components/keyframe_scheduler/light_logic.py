"""
Keyframe Scheduler - light control decisions.

Pure logic without Home Assistant imports, so it can be tested on its own.
The HA side (light_control.py) gathers the facts — light state, context of
a change, time — and asks these functions what to do:

- plan_step:          what to send to a light now, and when to look at it again?
- is_manual_change:   was a reported change made by someone else?
- should_resume:      may a manually paused light follow again?
